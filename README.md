# Perceptron
This is an implementation for a perceptron to recognize the function f(a,b,c) = a, where a, b, c belongs to {0,1}. We just need a single neuron to complete this task.

## Usage

For now we are using inputs written inside the code, whithout taking it from any user input or external file. In case you desire test it with other test cases,
feel free to download the code souce and insert the test cases you desire. Otherwise, just hit the run button in your IDE. The code will display the inicial weights,
the weights after training (which allows us verify that the "neural network" was able to recognize the function), the test inputs and its output.
